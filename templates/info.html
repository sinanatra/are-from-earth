      <h2 style="color: black">Text Embedding and Sexism </h2>
      <p style="color: black">
        The disproportionate often irresponsive use of Machine learning Algorithms risks to emphasise stereotypes already present
        in data. Whenever data reflects biases of the broader society, the learning algorithm captures and learns from these
        stereotypes. Most of the work done by researchers and industries is focusing on the performance and optimization
        of learning algorithm, always from a learner’s perspective. Terms like “Algorithmic Bias” are showing up more often
        on international press when software used to predict future criminals are biased against blacks, or Google Translate
        assign a sex to gender neutral sentences. Even more examples could be mentioned, from Extremist ads on Youtube to
        links between apps for gay men and sex offenders. Machines just learn from what we show them. The misconfusing definitions
        of Artificial Intelligence or Machine learning should be instead replaced by the term Machine Teaching, as it is
        in the teacher that lies the responsibility of deciding what to transmit, what task and what to study. Placing the
        responsibility on the teacher helps us to realise how tricky this process is. We shouldn’t just focus on fixing the
        mistakes in these machines, but we have to be more careful on deciding which examples giving them as inputs and therefore
        on what we teach them. Artificial Intelligence is now in every object, from phones to lights, from maps to lockers.
        Critiques on Artificial intelligence are often focused on speculation, mainly with a sci-fi dystopian point of view.
        Researchers are constantly improving the performance of the employed algorithms, testing their “intelligence” in
        many different contexts. Examples often depicts Computers defeating the world champion of Go, which has clear paths
        to victory or defeat. But intelligence is more than a sophisticated form of pattern recognition, intelligence is
        also social and tactile as researches in cognitive science suggests: bodily interactions are crucial to how we grasp
        more abstract mental concepts. A.I should be therefore studied, tested and embodied in different environments.
