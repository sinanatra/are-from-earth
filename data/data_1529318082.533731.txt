As a Designer that sets up an Exhibition, the designer that creates a dataset should follow the same design process. designer -> Exposition -> Human designer -> dataset-> AI An exhibition designer thinks about what to display to the public and how to show it, the “dataset designer” instead has to take the same decisions to facilitate A.I’s learning. The designer takes upon her/himself the responsibility to decide where to gather informations from, how to order them and consequently how to deal with biases.
