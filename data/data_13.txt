Examples that on a different level are close to this topic are the questions if we should remove Confederate heritage in the U.S and fascist architecture in Italy. Even if these statues and buildings might fuel rightist nostalgia, the decision to remove a part of our history shouldn’t be taken lightly. We might even ask ourselves if we perhaps should even avoid to fix biases in these machines, as they reflect our society, but instead acknowledge that. We shouldn’t see this as problems to solve but as possibilities, what could they teach us? And whose responsibility is to decide what’s right and what’s wrong?
