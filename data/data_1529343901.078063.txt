Two Monkeys by Brueghel - Poem by Wislawa Szymborska I keep dreaming of my graduation exam: in a window sit two chained monkeys, beyond the window floats the sky, and the sea splashes. I am taking an exam on the history of mankind: I stammer and flounder. One monkey, eyes fixed upon me, listens ironically, the other seems to be dozing- and when silence follows a question, he prompts me with a soft jingling of the chain. Wislawa Szymborska
